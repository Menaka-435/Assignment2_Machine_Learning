Course: CS5710 - Machine Learning, Fall 2025

Overview

This assignment implements three machine learning tasks on the Iris dataset:

Decision Tree Classification (Q7)

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classification & Decision Boundaries (Q8)

kNN Performance Evaluation (Metrics & ROC/AUC) (Q9)

The purpose is to train models, visualize decision boundaries, and evaluate classification performance using standard metrics.
